&ldquo;As Innkeepers at Bull Run, I feel a responsibility to protect the historic character of our property as this region grows. We can do the same with an investment in the CPA for Shirley.
Just as we support the many institutions and events that give Shirley its small town feel, we fully support adoption of the CPA.&rdquo;

&ldquo;As a parent with a 2nd grader and soon to be kindergartner in the Shirley school district, it is very important to me to be to good steward of the community in which my children will grow up in and to raise my children in a town they can be proud of!  That means protecting our drinking water supply, supporting our senior and veteran residents and supporting our local parks and recreation projects.  With raised funds being matched by the state for such programs, it’s a win-win for our town and residents.&rdquo;

&ldquo;After moving to Shirley with my family, I knew that this town would be our forever home. The historic charm, the small town feel, the amazing people, the beautiful trees - Shirley is just a wonderful place to live! I believe that creating a CPA fund will further preserve our town’s history and allow us to make it even more beautiful. I hope everyone will use their voices to vote in favor of supporting Shirley on May 2nd!&rdquo;
