> &ldquo;The Community Preservation Act is a critical tool for Shirley to preserve its historic charm and character, maintain its open spaces, and to leverage state funds to invest in the town’s future. I fully endorse the campaign to adopt the CPA. Vote YES on May 2!&rdquo;<br><br>
&mdash; <span style="font-style: normal;">Senator John J. Cronin</span>, *Massachusetts State Senator representing the Worcester and Middlesex District (including Shirley)*

> &ldquo;As a lifelong resident of Shirley, I have always had the benefit of living in a well cared for community. Adopting the Community Preservation Act would allow our town to further preserve and maintain its historic buildings, open spaces, recreation and conservation land that we very much enjoy. Furthermore, it would allow us access to partial matching State funds that we could invest in the Town for the benefit of the next generation.&rdquo;<br><br>
&mdash; <span style="font-style: normal;">Bryan Sawyer</span>, *Chair, Select Board*

> &ldquo;Abutting towns, e.g., Groton where I lived for 60 years, have taken full advantage of the matching funds made available by CPA to provide open space, affordable housing, recreation and the preservation of historic buildings. It is a great program. More recently, the Town of Ayer, where I live now, passed the Massachusetts Community Preservation Act and is taking advantage of its many benefits. I hope that the Town of Shirley will vote to do the same!&rdquo;<br><br>

> &ldquo;As curator at the Shirley Historical Society Museum, I know many historic locations in town. Some of these locations are in good condition and are protected. Other sites are endangered and/or in need of restoration work. The town will have access to matching state funds for historic preservation projects through the Community Preservation Act. I urge everyone’s support.&rdquo;<br><br>
