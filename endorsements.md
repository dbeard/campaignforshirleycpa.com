> Abutting towns, e.g., Groton where I lived for 60 years, have taken full advantage of the matching funds made available by CPA to provide open space, affordable housing, recreation and the preservation of historic buildings. It is a great program. More recently, the Town of Ayer, where I live now, passed the Massachusetts Community Preservation Act and is taking advantage of its many benefits. I hope that the Town of Shirley will vote to do the same!

Marion Stoddart, *Nashua River Watershed Association Founder, United Nations Honoree*

> The Community Preservation Act is a critical tool for Shirley to preserve its historic charm and character, maintain its open spaces, and to leverage state funds to invest in the town’s future. I fully endorse the campaign to adopt the CPA. Vote YES on May 2!

Senator John J. Cronin, *Massachusetts State Senator representing the Worcester and Middlesex District (including Shirley)*

> As curator at the Shirley Historical Society Museum, I know many historic locations in town. Some of these locations are in good condition and are protected. Other sites are endangered and/or in need of restoration work. The town will have access to matching state funds for historic preservation projects through the Community Preservation Act. I urge everyone’s support.

Meredith Marcinkewicz, *Curator of the Shirley Historical Society Museum*
