> &ldquo;The Community Preservation Act is a critical tool for Shirley to preserve its historic charm and character, maintain its open spaces, and to leverage state funds to invest in the town’s future. I fully endorse the campaign to adopt the CPA. Vote YES on May 2!&rdquo;<br><br>
&mdash; <span style="font-style: normal;">Senator John J. Cronin</span>, *Massachusetts State Senator representing the Worcester and Middlesex District (including Shirley)*

> &ldquo;As a lifelong resident of Shirley, I have always had the benefit of living in a well cared for community. Adopting the Community Preservation Act would allow our town to further preserve and maintain its historic buildings, open spaces, recreation and conservation land that we very much enjoy. Furthermore, it would allow us access to partial matching State funds that we could invest in the Town for the benefit of the next generation.&rdquo;<br><br>
&mdash; <span style="font-style: normal;">Bryan Sawyer</span>, *Chair, Select Board*

> &ldquo;Abutting towns, e.g., Groton where I lived for 60 years, have taken full advantage of the matching funds made available by CPA to provide open space, affordable housing, recreation and the preservation of historic buildings. It is a great program. More recently, the Town of Ayer, where I live now, passed the Massachusetts Community Preservation Act and is taking advantage of its many benefits. I hope that the Town of Shirley will vote to do the same!&rdquo;<br><br>

> &ldquo;Please join me in supporting a positive vote in favor of the Community Preservation Act on the Shirley Town Election ballot May 2nd. ‘Preservation Pays,’ and with your support the Town of Shirley will reinforce its ability to manage future growth, along with the maintenance of historic structures and our rural character for generations to come.&rdquo;<br><br>
&mdash; <span style="font-style: normal;">Chip Guercio</span>, *Shirley Town Moderator*

> &ldquo;As curator at the Shirley Historical Society Museum, I know many historic locations in town. Some of these locations are in good condition and are protected. Other sites are endangered and/or in need of restoration work. The town will have access to matching state funds for historic preservation projects through the Community Preservation Act. I urge everyone’s support.&rdquo;<br><br>
&mdash; <span style="font-style: normal;">Meredith Marcinkewicz</span>, *Curator of the Shirley Historical Society Museum*

> &ldquo;I love Shirley because of its people, especially the children of Shirley and its surrounding communities. I also love Shirley for the opportunities it provides for kids to learn how to swim or have access to a number of other sports. It is also has areas where families are able enjoy the natural beauty of rural New England. Therefore, having a CPA is an investment in the here and now as well as for our future generations. So, let us commit to that investment by voting Yes on May 2nd.&rdquo;<br><br>

> &ldquo;I love living here in Shirley, MA. This wonderful town has many wonderful rural and historical qualities. The CPA will help us to keep and preserve Shirley as the beautiful rural town that it is. The funding from the CPA can be used for many needed preservation projects as well as to buy conservation land. That is why I am voting yes to Support the CPA and I hope you will too.&rdquo;<br><br>
