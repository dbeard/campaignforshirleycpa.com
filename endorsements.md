> Abutting towns, e.g., Groton where I lived for 60 years, have taken full advantage of the matching funds made available by CPA to provide open space, affordable housing, recreation and the preservation of historic buildings. It is a great program. More recently, the Town of Ayer, where I live now, passed the Massachusetts Community Preservation Act and is taking advantage of its many benefits. I hope that the Town of Shirley will vote to do the same!
