> &ldquo;The Community Preservation Act is a critical tool for Shirley to preserve its historic charm and character, maintain its open spaces, and to leverage state funds to invest in the town’s future. I fully endorse the campaign to adopt the CPA. Vote YES on May 2!&rdquo;<br><br>
&mdash; <span style="font-style: normal;">Senator John J. Cronin</span>, *Massachusetts State Senator representing the Worcester and Middlesex District (including Shirley)*

> &ldquo;As a lifelong resident of Shirley, I have always had the benefit of living in a well cared for community. Adopting the Community Preservation Act would allow our town to further preserve and maintain its historic buildings, open spaces, recreation and conservation land that we very much enjoy. Furthermore, it would allow us access to partial matching State funds that we could invest in the Town for the benefit of the next generation.&rdquo;<br><br>
&mdash; <span style="font-style: normal;">Bryan Sawyer</span>, *Chair, Select Board*

> &ldquo;Abutting towns, e.g., Groton where I lived for 60 years, have taken full advantage of the matching funds made available by CPA to provide open space, affordable housing, recreation and the preservation of historic buildings. It is a great program. More recently, the Town of Ayer, where I live now, passed the Massachusetts Community Preservation Act and is taking advantage of its many benefits. I hope that the Town of Shirley will vote to do the same!&rdquo;<br><br>
&mdash; <span style="font-style: normal;">Marion Stoddart</span>, *Nashua River Watershed Association Founder, United Nations Honoree*

> &ldquo;Please join me in supporting a positive vote in favor of the Community Preservation Act on the Shirley Town Election ballot May 2nd. ‘Preservation Pays,’ and with your support the Town of Shirley will reinforce its ability to manage future growth, along with the maintenance of historic structures and our rural character for generations to come.&rdquo;<br><br>
&mdash; <span style="font-style: normal;">Chip Guercio</span>, *Shirley Town Moderator*

> &ldquo;As curator at the Shirley Historical Society Museum, I know many historic locations in town. Some of these locations are in good condition and are protected. Other sites are endangered and/or in need of restoration work. The town will have access to matching state funds for historic preservation projects through the Community Preservation Act. I urge everyone’s support.&rdquo;<br><br>
&mdash; <span style="font-style: normal;">Meredith Marcinkewicz</span>, *Curator of the Shirley Historical Society Museum*

> &ldquo;I love Shirley because of its people, especially the children of Shirley and its surrounding communities. I also love Shirley for the opportunities it provides for kids to learn how to swim or have access to a number of other sports. It is also has areas where families are able enjoy the natural beauty of rural New England. Therefore, having a CPA is an investment in the here and now as well as for our future generations. So, let us commit to that investment by voting Yes on May 2nd.&rdquo;<br><br>
&mdash; <span style="font-style: normal;">Cliff Bailey</span>, *Shirley Penguins Head Coach*

> &ldquo;I love living here in Shirley, MA. This wonderful town has many wonderful rural and historical qualities. The CPA will help us to keep and preserve Shirley as the beautiful rural town that it is. The funding from the CPA can be used for many needed preservation projects as well as to buy conservation land. That is why I am voting yes to Support the CPA and I hope you will too.&rdquo;<br><br>
&mdash; <span style="font-style: normal;">Timna Sandoval</span>, *Shirley Resident*

> &ldquo;The CPA would be a great asset to Shirley. It meets a range of community needs, invests in our small town and draws in additional funds from the state match. I completely support the passage of the CPA.&rdquo;<br><br>
&mdash; <span style="font-style: normal;">Brian Hildebrant</span>, *Chair, Shirley Finance Committee*

> &ldquo;The CPA will provide funding for projects and programs that directly benefit the residents of Shirley. We have goals! We have plans! Check out the Town Website to see the Master Plan and the Open Space and Recreation Plan (and more!) The CPA will provide the resources we need to turn those goals into reality.&rdquo;<br><br>
&mdash; <span style="font-style: normal;">Sarah Widing</span>, *Shirley Resident*

> &ldquo;I want to see us get the funding to improve certain parts of our downtown.&rdquo;<br><br>
&mdash; <span style="font-style: normal;">Liz Johnson</span>, *Shirley Resident*

> &ldquo;I look at CPA as a way to create a savings plan for Shirley - a fund that grows over time and can be used to improve our parks and playing fields, protect open space & preserve Shirley's historic heritage, a fund increased by money from the state that would otherwise flow to surrounding towns, all of which have adopted CPA. We're missing out - vote yes!&rdquo;<br><br>
&mdash; <span style="font-style: normal;">Janet Tice</span>, *Shirley Planning Board*

> &ldquo;The Community Preservation Act is an investment in your property. With all the great benefits it brings to the community, you will see property values go up too.&rdquo;<br><br>
&mdash; <span style="font-style: normal;">Joyce Reischutz</span>, *School Committee*

> &ldquo;Common sense says if the state is gonna match some of our funds why wouldn’t you? $40-50 a year for the greater good for all in our town.&rdquo;<br><br>
&mdash; <span style="font-style: normal;">Tina Shepherd</span>, *Shirley Resident*

> &ldquo;The CPA gives our town a chance to control our future--have a say in how and where we grow and where we conserve land--the land that is so essential to our sense of place.&rdquo;<br><br>
&mdash; <span style="font-style: normal;">Rembs Layman</span>, *Shirley Resident*

> &ldquo;The CPA represents an investment, a personal and local investment, in what makes Shirley a great place to live. It can be used to protect natural places. It can ensure that our young and old community members have outdoor places to play sports and relax. Each of our small contributions to this fund can add up to enable tangible and lasting improvements in the quality of life for all in the Shirley community.&rdquo;<br><br>
